# IP Address Tracker

This is a tracker that works when inserting a IP or a Domain and uses 2 APIs(IP Geolocation API(data), leaftlet(map)). 

## How it works
If succesfull, it shows the location (ip, city, region, postal code, timezone, isp), if not, it shows a simple error message. The map is linked to the values and it shows the realtime location of the IP(or domain) searched.
